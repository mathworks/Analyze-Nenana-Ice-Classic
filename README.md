The Nenana Ice Classic is an annual event that takes place in Nenana, Alaska. It is a guessing game where people try to predict the exact time when the ice on the Tanana River will break up in the spring. 
Participants purchase tickets for a small fee and guess the month, day, hour, and minute when the tripod, which is placed on the frozen river, will move and stop the clock. The tripod is connected to a wire that is attached to a clock on the riverbank. When the ice starts to melt, the tripod moves with the current, and when it falls through the ice, the wire pulls a rope that stops the clock. 
You can find  the exact dates and times of ice breakup have been collected since 2017 and reported on a calendar in the [Nenana Ice Classic Brochure](https://www.nenanaakiceclassic.com/brochures) on the [Nenana Ice Classic Website](https://www.nenanaakiceclassic.com/).

## **Information**<br>
This curriculum module contains interactive MATLAB &reg;   live script that explores the Nenana Ice Classic data of ice breakup times from 1917-2021.

## **Background**<br>
You can use this live scripts as a demonstration in lectures, class activities, or interactive assignments outside class. This module enables students to evaluate available data and apply mathematical modeling, specifically linear approximation. Students use a computational tool, MATLAB, to import, clean, plot, and generate fits for their data. Students discuss the accuracy of their results and apply their fits to make predictions on dates of ice breakage for the Nenana Ice Classic challenge.
The instructions inside the live script will guide you through the exercises and activities. Get started with each live script by running it one section at a time. To stop running the script or a section midway (for example, when an animation is in progress), use the  Stop button in the RUN section of the Live Editor tab in the MATLAB Toolstrip.
